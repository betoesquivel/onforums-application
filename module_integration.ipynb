      " 'body': [u'Theresa May\\u2019s draft \\u201csnooper\\u2019s charter\\u201d bill fails to cover all the intrusive spying powers of the security agencies and lacks clarity in its privacy protections, a parliamentary committee has said.',\n",
      "          u'The intelligence and security committee said the draft legislation published by the home secretary suffered from a lack of sufficient time and preparation. It was evident that even those working on the legislation had not always been clear about what it was intended to achieve, it said. ',\n",
      "          u'The unexpectedly critical intervention by the ISC, which is nominated by the prime minister and chaired by the former Conservative attorney general, Dominic Grieve, comes just two days before a key scrutiny committee of MPs and peers is to deliver its verdict on the draft legislation aimed at regulating the surveillance powers of the security agencies.',\n",
      "          u'The draft investigatory powers bill will include new powers for the security agencies to access the web browsing histories of UK citizens for up to 12 months, as well as establishing a fresh legal framework for their existing capabilities to track web and phone use and engage in computer hacking.',\n",
      "          u'The ISC said in its report that it supported the government\\u2019s intention to provide greater transparency around the security services\\u2019 intrusive powers in the aftermath of the Edward Snowden mass surveillance disclosures.',\n",
      "          u'\\u201cIt is nevertheless disappointing that the draft bill does not cover all the agencies\\u2019 intrusive capabilities \\u2013 as the committee recommended last year,\\u201d Grieve said.',\n",
      "          u'\\u201cThis means that the various powers and authorisations remain scattered throughout different pieces of legislation and, as a result, the draft bill is limited in the extent to which it can provide a comprehensive legal framework. In our view it is a missed opportunity.\\u201d',\n",
      "          u'The report said the bill failed to deliver the clarity needed in this area. ',\n",
      "          u'While the issues involved were undoubtedly complex, Grieve said, \\u201cit has been evident that even those working on the legislation have not always been clear as to what the provisions are intended to be\\u201d.',\n",
      "          u'The committee members said they had expected to find universal privacy protections at the forefront of the bill but instead a piecemeal approach had been taken which \\u201clacks clarity and undermines the importance of safeguards associated with these powers\\u201d. They suggest dedicated privacy protections be included to form the backbone of the legislation and ensure privacy was not just an add-on.',\n",
      "          u'\\u201cGiven the background to the draft bill and the public concern over the allegations made by Edward Snowden in 2013, it is surprising that the protection of people\\u2019s privacy \\u2013 which is enshrined in other legislation \\u2013 does not feature more prominently,\\u201d they said. ',\n",
      "          u'The ISC proposed three other major changes to the bill:',\n",
      "          u'\\u201cWe consider these changes necessary if the government is to bring forward legislation which provides the security and intelligence agencies with the investigatory powers they require, while protecting our privacy through robust safeguards and controls,\\u201d Grieve said.'],\n",

      "          u'The intelligence and security committee said the draft legislation published by the home secretary suffered from a lack of sufficient time and preparation. It was evident that even those working on the legislation had not always been clear about what it was intended to achieve, it said. ',\n",
      "          u'The unexpectedly critical intervention by the ISC, which is nominated by the prime minister and chaired by the former Conservative attorney general, Dominic Grieve, comes just two days before a key scrutiny committee of MPs and peers is to deliver its verdict on the draft legislation aimed at regulating the surveillance powers of the security agencies.',\n",
      "          u'The draft investigatory powers bill will include new powers for the security agencies to access the web browsing histories of UK citizens for up to 12 months, as well as establishing a fresh legal framework for their existing capabilities to track web and phone use and engage in computer hacking.',\n",
      "          u'The ISC said in its report that it supported the government\\u2019s intention to provide greater transparency around the security services\\u2019 intrusive powers in the aftermath of the Edward Snowden mass surveillance disclosures.',\n",
      "          u'\\u201cIt is nevertheless disappointing that the draft bill does not cover all the agencies\\u2019 intrusive capabilities \\u2013 as the committee recommended last year,\\u201d Grieve said.',\n",
      "          u'\\u201cThis means that the various powers and authorisations remain scattered throughout different pieces of legislation and, as a result, the draft bill is limited in the extent to which it can provide a comprehensive legal framework. In our view it is a missed opportunity.\\u201d',\n",
      "          u'The report said the bill failed to deliver the clarity needed in this area. ',\n",
      "          u'While the issues involved were undoubtedly complex, Grieve said, \\u201cit has been evident that even those working on the legislation have not always been clear as to what the provisions are intended to be\\u201d.',\n",
      "          u'The committee members said they had expected to find universal privacy protections at the forefront of the bill but instead a piecemeal approach had been taken which \\u201clacks clarity and undermines the importance of safeguards associated with these powers\\u201d. They suggest dedicated privacy protections be included to form the backbone of the legislation and ensure privacy was not just an add-on.',\n",
      "          u'\\u201cGiven the background to the draft bill and the public concern over the allegations made by Edward Snowden in 2013, it is surprising that the protection of people\\u2019s privacy \\u2013 which is enshrined in other legislation \\u2013 does not feature more prominently,\\u201d they said.
